User Management in Linux
Introduction to User Management in Linux
Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can operate on a system simultaneously. Proper user management ensures security, controlled access, and system integrity.

Key files involved in user management:

/etc/passwd – Stores user account details.
/etc/shadow – Stores encrypted user passwords.
/etc/group – Stores group information.
/etc/gshadow – Stores secure group details.
Creating Users in Linux
To create a new user in Linux, use:

useradd Command (For most Linux distributions)
useradd username
This creates a user without a home directory.

To create a user with a home directory:

useradd -m username
To specify a shell:

useradd -s /bin/bash username
adduser Command (For Debian-based systems)
adduser username
This is an interactive command that asks for a password and additional details.

Managing User Passwords
To set or change a user’s password:

passwd username
Enforcing Password Policies
Password expiration: Set password expiry days
chage -M 90 username
Lock a user account
passwd -l username
Unlock a user account
passwd -u username
Modifying Users
Modify an existing user with usermod:

Change the username:
usermod -l new_username old_username
Change the home directory:
usermod -d /new/home/directory -m username
Change the default shell:
usermod -s /bin/zsh username
Deleting Users
To remove a user but keep their home directory:

userdel username
To remove a user and their home directory:

userdel -r username
Working with Groups
Creating Groups
groupadd groupname
Adding Users to Groups
usermod -aG groupname username
Viewing Group Memberships

Changing Primary Group
usermod -g new_primary_group username
Sudo Access and Privilege Escalation
