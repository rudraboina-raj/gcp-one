## Concepts Simplified

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means renting servers, databases, storage, and other services over the internet instead of owning them.

In simple words:  
> "You pay only for what you use. No upfront investment, no maintenance headache."

**Cloud providers**: Google Cloud (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure
